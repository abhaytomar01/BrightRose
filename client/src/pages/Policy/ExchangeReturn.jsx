            <p>At BrightRose, every garment is crafted from fabric procured from weavers across India. These are one-of-a-kind pieces, made with intention and care—and our policies are designed to reflect that ethos.</p>

<h3>SHIPPING</h3>
<h4>Domestic Orders (India)</h4>
<p>We offer complimentary shipping across India on all orders. Standard domestic shipping will take 3-4 days, if the product is ready to ship.<br/>Certain products are made-to-order. The dispatch time frames for these vary between 2-4 weeks. The respective timelines are mentioned under the 'Notes' section in each product description for your convenience.</p>

<h4>International Orders</h4>
<p>We ship worldwide. Standard international shipping will take 8-10 days, if the product is ready to ship.<br/>
 A standard international shipping rate is applied at checkout based on your location. International orders may be subject to local customs duties and taxes, which are the responsibility of the customer.</p>
<h4>
Dispatch & Tracking</h4>
<p>Once your order has been dispatched, a tracking number will be shared via email. Please allow 24–48 hours for the tracking link to become active.</p>

<h4>Transit & Delivery</h4>
<p>BrightRose is not responsible for delays caused by third-party shipping carriers, customs clearance processes, or unforeseen logistical disruptions. Any damage or loss occurring during transit—once the order has been handed over to the courier—is beyond our liability. In such cases, we recommend reaching out directly to the shipping provider using the tracking information provided.</p>

<h4>TAXES + DUTIES</h4>
 
<p>As required by the regulatory authorities, all of our international shipments are accompanied by a commercial invoice. This implies that your order may be subject to import duties and/or local sales taxes that are levied once the package reaches the destination country. As the recipient, you are liable for payment of these to enable Customs to release your order on arrival.</p>
<p>The laws pertaining to import duties vary from country to country and hence we are not in a position to foretell what these charges may be in actuals. In some instances, there might also likely be no additional charges levied. However, we recommend you contact the local customs office in your country for further information.</p>
<p>BrightRose India Private Limited will not be responsible for non-delivery of orders in case the recipient is unable to settle the applicable taxes and duties at the delivery address. Such orders will not be eligible for a refund/credit note.</p>

<h4>RETURN + EXCHANGES & REFUNDS</h4>

<p>In order to minimise any discrepancies, almost all our products for direct sale on website address are free of conventional sizing. This mitigates the need for most return issues concerning inaccurate fit. However, if you are unsure of any aspect of the purchase, we implore you to contact a member of our client services team before placing any orders. Your purchase is eligible for return or exchange only if it meets the following conditions:<br/>

1.	An incorrect product has been delivered to you<br/>
2.	If the product you receive has a genuine manufacturing defect<br/>
Please note that each return or exchange request is considered as an individual case. We are unable to offer refunds if we have been given an incorrect or incomplete shipping address, or if there have been three (3) failed delivery attempts by our shipping partners and/or if the package has been refused by the recipient.</p>
 
<p>If your request meets our return criteria as stated above, please contact our client services team within three (3) days of delivery with the following information:<br/>
•	Your Order Number<br/>
•	The reason for return and in the case of a defective or incorrect product, please send us an image of the received garment<br/>
Please do not, send back the garments without any written confirmation from our client services team. No refunds would be made in such instances.<br/>
You may connect with us via:<br/>
e-mail: brightrose.india@gmail.com<br/> 
whatsapp: +91.XXXXXXXXXX<br/>
Once a confirmation for return has been given along with a pick-up schedule, please ensure that the product you return is unused, unworn and that the original tags are intact.</p>

<h4>Custom Orders</h4>
<p>All custom-made garments are final sale. Once a 100% advance has been received, the order is considered confirmed and is not eligible for cancellation, refund, or exchange.</p>

<h4>Sale & Altered Items</h4>
<p>All discounted, sale, or altered pieces are final sale and are not eligible for return, exchange, or refund.<br/> PLEASE NOTE: International orders are unfortunately not eligible for returns owing to logistical reasons and the stringent customs laws in India.</p>

<h4>Fabric Irregularities</h4>
<p>Most of our pieces are crafted from pure material procured directly from weavers across India. Minor irregularities are a part of the handloom process and are to be expected and are considered part of the fabric’s story, and craftsmanship. These are not considered defects and will not be accepted as grounds for return or complaint.</p>
<h4>Manufacturing Defects</h4>
<p>In the rare event of a genuine manufacturing issue on our part, we will assess the piece upon return and, if accepted, offer a repair or alteration free of cost. Refunds will not be issued under any circumstance.</p>
